		<h3>How do I interpret the Scansite score for my site?</h3>
		<p>
			Scores in Scansite start at 0.000 if the sequence optimally matches
			the given motif, and the scores increase for sequences as they
			diverge
			from
			the optimal match. The score histograms and the percentile
			are
			the main ways to tell how good a score is for a given motif. If
			your
			site ranks in the best 0.2% of all sites, that is quite good
			(this is
			the "high stringency" threshold value we use for most of the
			motifs).
			The Z score will also tell you how many standard deviations
			from the
			mean it is (the Z score will be negative because lower
			Scansite
			scores
			are better). For database searches, the percentile is
			calculated from
			all proteins you searched (a whole database, for
			example). For the
			Motif Scan program, the percentile is calculated
			from a reference
			database search, which is the vertebrate section of
			the Swiss-Prot
			database.
		</p>
		<p>
			It may be worthwhile to consider the surface accessibility of the
			predicted site, as shown by the plot below the graph of sites found.
			A site that can actually be reached by an interacting protein is
			better than a buried one.
			However, our surface accessibility is
			calculated from
			the sequence, and not with reference to any known
			structures, so
			its accuracy may be limited.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another way to assess the validity of a site found is to check
			whether it is conserved in related organisms. Clicking on the
			sequence will show you the position of the site within the protein,
			and on that page is a convenient link to submit the site to BLAST.

		</p>
		<h3>What is the format of user-defined motifs?</h3>
		<p>
			To use your own binding motif in a database search, you will
			need to
			define it in a text file and import
			the text file into Scansite. The
			format is a matrix of typically 20
			columns and
			15 rows. The columns are
			scores for the 20 amino acids at each
			position, and the 15 rows are
			positions of each residue in the
			binding pocket. Scansite requires one
			residue to be invariant
			in the motif sequence, such as a tyrosine for
			motifs recognized by tyrosine-kinases. (For motifs that recognize
			more
			than one residue in this position, such as kinases that
			phosphorylate
			both serine and threonine, multiple residues can be
			treated as
			equivalent in the fixed position.) The middle position, row
			8,
			holds the fixed residue in the matrix. Rows 1 through 7 hold
			the
			scores for positions to the left (N-terminal side) of the
			fixed
			position, and rows 9 through 15 hold the scores for those
			to the right
			(C-terminal) side. Finally, at the top of this
			20 by 15 matrix should
			be a row of column headings indicating
			the one-letter amino acid code.
		</p>
		<p>
			The actual number of columns in the matrix can be higher or lower
			than 20. If your peptide library
			screen did not include some
			residues,
			such as cysteine or tryptophan, these columns can be
			left
			out of your
			matrix and Scansite will assign them default
			values of 1
			everywhere
			except in the fixed position, where
			the
			default score
			is 0.
			Alternatively, if your motif targets the C
			terminus (as PDZ domains
			do), you can
			include an extra column
			giving scores for the C
			terminus,
			labeled with the symbol "*"
			(asterisk). The N
			terminus can be given
			scores in a column labeled
			"$" (dollar sign). When absent,
			Scansite
			assigns the N and
			C
			terminus columns values of zero by default.
			Selenoprotein
			researchers can add a column of scores labeled
			"U"
			for
			selenocysteine. When this
			column is absent, Scansite scores
			selenocysteines as cysteines. Simlarly,
			an "O"-column can be added to
			score pyrrolysines. If this column is not given
			pyrrolysines are
			scored as
			lysines. Finally, columns can
			be included
			for
			the
			degenerate
			symbols "B" (aspartate/asparagine), "Z"
			(glutamate/glutamine), "J"
			(leucine/isoleucine), and "X" (any
			residue) to score
			sequences
			containing these
			symbols in the public
			databases, although there
			is
			probably no
			research reason
			to include these in an input
			matrix.
			As a
			result of
			all these options, an input matrix can
			contain as
			many
			as 26
			columns, or even only 1
			column naming the
			fixed
			residue
			(such a matrix
			would not be
			very informative,
			however). The order
			of the
			residue columns
			is not
			important ("A"
			does not have to be
			first,
			and so on).
		</p>
		<p>
			An example will make this more clear. Below is a sample matrix.
			The
			full matrix might have 21 columns in
			this case (20 residues
			plus the
			C
			terminus), but only seven are shown here in order to
			fit well on
			the
			page.
			The first line in the text file contains
			the column
			headers
			(residue letters and the asterisk). These
			should be
			separated
			by tabs.
			In practice, it is easiest to do this
			by creating the
			whole
			matrix in a
			spreadsheet program and saving
			it as a tab-delimited text
			file. The
			next 15 lines are the 15
			positions
			relative to the
			fixed
			center at row 8.
			This motif is
			specific for tyrosine (or
			phosphotyrosine)
			in the center
			position,
			so tyrosine is the fixed residue. It must
			be
			given the value
			21 in
			row 8 for Scansite to recognize
			it as the fixed
			residue. All
			other
			values in row 8 must be zero. (For multiple
			residue
			possibilities at
			the
			fixed position, each of them must
			have
			the
			value 21 and the remaining
			residues must all be zero.) This
			motif
			also requires the C terminus to
			be four residues away from
			the
			center
			tyrosine (so the column "*" is
			given the value 21 at
			that position).
			In all the other rows, scores are
			given to
			represent the relative
			binding affinity for each residue type
			at
			each position in the
			sequence.

		<p>
			The scoring system ranges from 0 to roughly 21. Giving an
			individual
			amino acid a score of 1 at one
			position in the motif
			indicates that
			no
			preference exists, positive or negative, for
			that
			particular amino
			acid
			in that position. Giving all amino
			acids in one
			position of the
			motif
			a score of 1 (i.e. making all
			values in a single
			row of the
			matrix equal
			to one, as in the
			first two rows in the table
			shown above)
			indicates no
			preference
			exists for any particular residue
			type at that position in the
			motif. A score of 15
			means that residue
			has 15 chances out of
			21 to be
			the selected residue, which is a very
			strong affinity.
			It is not
			necessary
			to normalize the scores at one
			position to
			add up to 21; Scansite
			will
			normalize them
			during program
			execution. Values higher than 21 are
			permitted if you wish to
			indicate
			very strong
			affinities.
			Values between
			0 and 1 can be
			used for very low
			affinities, but negative
			numbers cannot.
			Beware
			that the scoring
			function uses natural logarithms, so
			values
			less
			than 1, particularly
			those less than 0.5,
			strongly
			penalize for
			that
			particular residue in a
			motif. In fact, the
			penalty of negative selection
			from a
			matrix value of
			0.1 in the
			final score is equivalent
			(though
			opposite) to the positive
			selection obtained
			with a value of 10 for
			another residue in the
			motif.
			Consequently, choose values less
			than 1
			(other than 0)
			carefully. This
			matrix favors the C terminus, but for
			motifs not
			showing any special
			affinity for the N or
			C
			terminus, scores
			in
			the "$" and "*" columns (if
			present) should be zero. No commas
			or
			other punctuation
			should separate
			matrix values. Only tabs
			are
			permitted
			between columns.
		</p>
		<p>While the center position must have a fixed residue, it is
			also
			possible
			to fix other positions as well
			(as done in this example for
			the
			C terminus).
			As another example, suppose your motif requires
			aspartate in
			row
			5 (three
			residues N-terminal to the fixed center). To
			do this, give that
			aspartate
			the value 21 in row
			5, and make all other
			amino acid values equal
			to 0.
			Conversely, you should avoid giving
			residues the
			special score of 21 if
			they are not intended to be fixed
			positions; use values like
			20.9 or 21.1
			instead.
		</p>
		<p>Making an effective matrix can be a challenging task. You will
			often need to change some values to keep
			the resulting output
			reasonable. If your affinity
			values are from an experimental source,
			we recommend that your
			changes preserve the rank ordering of the raw
			values, so that
			your motif is as strongly grounded in experiment as
			possible.
		</p>
		<h3>What are Regular Expressions and how can I use them in
			Scansite?</h3>
		<p>
			All the text input fields in this search allow regular expressions,
			which are familiar to users of Perl
			and Unix shell scripts. For
			example, you can search for a sequence like MKRAALP in the simplest
			way by
			specifying it exactly in the input field, "MKRAALP", but if the
			two alanines can really be any two
			residues, then search for "MKR..LP"
			(the period means any character). If there could be more or less than
			two residues between the MKR and LP parts, use "MKR.+LP" (the plus
			sign means one or more of the
			preceding period wildcard). Using
			"MKR.*LP" will match even zero residues between the MKR and LP parts.
			If the first alanine really is required, but the second one could
			alternatively be valine or isoleucine,
			search for "MKRA[AVI]P" -- any
			of the residues in brackets can be in that position. A sequence
			containing
			one or more repeats of LVM in a row would be "(LVM)+".
			There are some differences between regular
			expression syntax as used
			in different environments. Scansite uses the syntax of MySQL's REGEXP
			operator,
			for which the complete usage rules are as follows:
		</p>
		<table>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>^</td>
					<td>Match the beginning of the string only.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>$</td>
					<td>Match the end of the string.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>.</td>
					<td>Match any single character, including a space or return
						character.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>[...]</td>
					<td>Match any character appearing between the brackets.</td>
				</tr>

					<td>[^...]</td>

						<em>not</em>
						appearing between the
						brackets.

					<td>e|f</td>
					<td>Match pattern element e or pattern element f.</td>

				<tr>
					<td>e{m}</td>
					<td>Match m instances of pattern element e.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>e{m,}</td>
					<td>Match m or more instances of pattern element e.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>e{,n}</td>
					<td>Match zero to n instances of pattern element e.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>e{m,n}</td>
					<td>Match m to n instances of pattern element e.</td>
				</tr>

					<td>(...)</td>
					<td>Group pattern elements into a single element.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>other</td>
					<td>All other characters match themselves.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>
			To search for one of the special symbols [, ], $, ^, +, and
			so on (in
			the keyword search, for example),
			use a backslash first:
			"\[", "\]",
			"\$", "\^", "\+", etc. This indicates that you want the
			literal
			character rather than its syntactic meaning. Longer
			discussions of
			regular expressions can usually be
			found as a chapter
			in a Perl book,
			or on the web (try
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>
			or
			<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/helpsheets/regex.html"
				target="_blank">this</a>
			resource).
