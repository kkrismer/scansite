        <h3>Scan protein for motifs</h3>
        <p>This program will scan a protein of your choice for all of the motifs in Scansite,
            for a subset of them, or for a motif you prepared and uploaded. You can either use
            a protein entry in public databases (SwissProt, TrEMBL, Genpept, Ensembl, Yeast),
            or your own protein sequence.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Select or enter a protein:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you want to <b>use a protein from a public database</b>, select
                        <i>Protein Accession</i> from the "Choose Protein By" listbox.
                        Next, select a database and enter the protein's accession number/ID.
                        For databases that provide multiple accession numbers or IDs for
                        their entries, all of those should be found. To check if the protein
                        is available in our database mirror, click the "Check!" button.
                        The accession-field turns green if the protein exists, and red
                        in case the entered string does not match any of our records.
                        If you don't know the accession number or ID, you can use the
                        links on this page ("Search ...").

                        You can also <b>enter a protein sequence</b> by selecting <i>Input Sequence</i>
                        from the the "Choose Protein By" listbox. You will have to enter a
                        protein name and copy/paste your sequence into the given input fields.
                        If numbers, spaces, or other invalid characters are included in the sequence,
                        Scansite will remove them.

                        motifs/groups here. If you select a group, all of the motifs that belong to that
                        group will be included in your protein scan. However, you do not have to select
                        a group. To see an overview of how motifs are categorized into groups,

            <li>
                Choose a stringency level: high, medium, low, or minimum.
                <br />
                This sets how high a sequence must score when compared to all sequences that match the
                motif within the reference scoring proteome used (by default the entire vertebrate
                collection of SwissProt proteins) to be shown in the result list.
                <br />
                <b>High stringency</b>
                indicates that the motif identified in the query sequence is within the top <b>0.2%</b>
                of all matching sequences contained in vertebrate SwissProt proteins.
                <b>Medium and low stringency</b>
                scores correspond to the top <b>1% and 5%</b> of sequence matches, respectively.
                The choice of <b>minimum</b> sets the threshold to <b>15%</b>, which basically allows
                most sites to pass. For uploaded motifs no reference proteome information is available.
                Therefore, a default score threshold of 5 is used.
                <br />

                Sites identified under high stringency scoring are likely to be correct, though
                there is a possibility that real sites will fail to be identified (i.e. a non-zero
                false negative selection rate). In contrast, medium, low, and minimum stringency
                scoring has a much lower rate of false-negative predictions, but tends to over-call
                motif sites, resulting in increasing numbers of false positive hits.

                To show domains recognized in your sequence, check the box labeled
                "Show predicted domains". Otherwise, uncheck it. Scansite uses
                <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/pfa/iprscan/" target="_blank">InterProScan</a>
                to find a sequence's PFAM-domains. For this reason, the domain positions
                that are showed on the results page may differ slightly from domains
                the <a href="http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/" target="_blank">PFAM web page</a> returns.
            </li>
            <li>If you do not want to have your result sites compared to the default reference
                proteome (Vertebrates from Swissprot) you can check "Use Non-Standard Reference Proteome".
                This allows you to choose an alternative reference proteome: the Yeast Database.

                    If you requested domains in your sequence to be shown, they will be marked as

                    likely to be near the protein surface and thus able to interact with other proteins.
                    However, our surface accessibility is calculated from the sequence, and not with
                    reference to any known structures, so its accuracy may be limited. Between these to plots,
                    a simple ruler indicates every hundredth position in the sequence.

                    the sites
                    are sorted by groups.

        <b>Notes and Hints:</b>
        <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Most of the program execution time for Protein Scan is spent
                retrieving the Pfam
                domains. If you do not need domain information
                and have a lot of proteins
                to scan,
                you can save time by unselecting
                the "Show Predicted Domains" option.
            </li>
            <li>If motifs you expect are not found in your protein at Scansite's
                default "High"
                threshold setting, try using the "Medium" or "Low"
                settings. The "Low"
                setting often
                overwhelms the graphical display
                unless you are scanning with a small
                number of selected motifs.
                However, even if the graphical display
                looks cluttered, the table of
                results is always easily readable (just
                longer).
            </li>
            <li>Scansite scores are ranked on a 0 to infinity scale, where 0
                means
                a protein sequence perfectly matches the optimal binding
                pattern,
                and
                larger numbers indicate progressively poorer matches to
                the optimal
                consensus sequence. Lower scores in the output are thus
                better matches. (In the matrices, higher scores are better, so you
                should still use higher numbers in self-made matrices to indicate
                high affinities.)
            </li>
            <li>Clicking on the 15-residue sequence displayed in the results
                table shows the position of the site within the full protein
                sequence. Also, the page generated gives you a chance to submit
                this
                15-mer peptide to BLAST. This can let you check whether this
                site's
                sequence is conserved in organisms expected to be
                physiologically
                similar to this hit.

            <li>If the sites found by Motif Scan seem believable, you can use the
                motifs for those sites to search databases for other hits. In
                favorable cases, this can allow you to piece together parts of a
                pathway, if the interacting parts of different proteins can be
                connected.
