        <h3>Find Sequence Matches in a Database</h3>
        <p>This program searches all proteins in a selected (subset of a)
            database for
            sequence patterns.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                First of all, please select a "Search Method":
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Choose
                        <b>Sequence Pattern(s)</b>
                        if you want to search a database for occurrences
                        of up to five
                        sequence patterns. Follow the instructions displayed
                        on the page.

                        The alternative option,
                        <b>Regular Expression</b>
                        allows you to search for
                        more complicated sequence patterns. Some
                        examples are given when you
                        select
                        this option. For more
                        information about regular expressions, please

            <li>
                If you are looking for proteins with specific characteristics,
                you can restrict the search to get a shorter list of more relevant
                results. Just click the links next to the input fields to get more
                information on what you are allowed to enter. If you do not want
                to
                specify any restrictions, you can leave all the restriction fields
                blank.
                Unrestricted searches can take a very long time, so we
                recommend
                you to restrict your search
                (especially if you choose to
                search one of the bigger protein databases:
                TrEmbl, or GenPept).
            </li>
            <li>Click "Submit" to start the search.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            <i>The runtime of your search is highly dependent on the size of the
                database you chose.
                It can take up to several minutes if you select
                one of the larger
                databases (TrEMBL, Genpept)
                or if you do not
                restrict your search at all.

            the results will be displayed.

        <ul>
            <li>
                The search options in this and the other Scansite database
                programs
                are
                intended to address common problems with database searches. For
                many
                searches, you may only be interested in matches from humans
                or a
                model organism. Restricting your search to proteins from a
                single
                species is done by entering that species name in the "Single
                species" text box. Scansite uses a MySQL database, and the regular
                expressions syntax supported by MySQL allows certain helpful
                wildcards. For example, if you are tired of writing out
                "Caenorhabditis elegans", you can use "C.* elegans" instead. In a
                regular
                expression, the period (.) matches any single character, and
                the asterisk
                extends
                that match to multiple characters (or even zero
                characters). You could
                also do genus-wide
                searches, by entering
                "Rattus" for example. If you try doing that
                with "Mus", you will
                accidentally match "Ther
                <U>mus</U>
                aquaticus" as well, but you can
                avoid that by entering "^Mus". The
                caret symbol (^) requires the text
                to match at the beginning
                of the
                entered name. Another pitfall to avoid is specifying an
                invertebrate
                species like "Drosophila melanogaster" when your Organism Class
                setting
                is "Mammals". You will get
                no hits, because no entry in
                Genpept has a source organism that is
                both a mammal
                and a fruit fly.
                (At least, the Genpept curators hope no entry like
                that is present.)

            <li>
                The molecular weight, isoelectric point, and phosphorylation
                options are intended for use in conjunction with two-dimensional
                gel
                electrophoresis experiments. When you find a few spots
                appearing
                reproducibly on a 2D gel under a particular test
                condition and not
                under the control, you could use
                Scansite to find what proteins are
                expected to be in that region of the
                2-D gel by
                putting in a molecular
                weight range and isoelectric point. You
                could simultaneously
                constrain the species to match the cell line
                you used in the
                experiment. If it is an experiment involving
                possible phosphorylation
                events, you can see how much a putative
                phosphorylation would move it
                on the gel.
            </li>
            <li>
                The keyword search is primarily only useful for searching
                Swiss-Prot, because of its detailed annotations. It might be
                useful
                in Genpept if you are searching for novel proteins, in
                which case you
                could search for phrases like "hypothetical".
            </li>
            <li>
                The "Sequence contains" text field is a quick way to restrict
                your
                search to proteins containing a consensus sequence. Please note
                that
                the desired consensus sequence does NOT need to be part of the
                motif
                being
                searched for. Regular expressions have to be used here
                instead of the
                protein
                wildcard signs ("." instead of "X", "[ND]"
                instead of "B",...). For
                example, the
                sequence "PXXP" is represented
                as "P..P" in regular expression syntax.
                More details
                about regular
                expressions are given on the "FAQ" page.
