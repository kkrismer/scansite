		<h3>Scan protein for motifs</h3>
		<p>This program will scan a protein of your choice for all of the
			motifs in
			Scansite, for a subset of them, or for a motif you prepared
			and uploaded.
			You can either use a protein entry in public databases
			(SwissProt,
			TrEMBL,
			Genpept, Ensembl, Yeast), or your own protein
			sequence.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Select or enter a protein:
				<ul>
					<li>
						If you want to
						<b>use a protein from a public database</b>
						, select
						<i>Protein Accession</i>
						from the "Choose Protein By" listbox.
						Next, select a database and
						enter the protein's accession number/ID.
						For databases that
						provide
						multiple accession numbers or IDs for
						their
						entries, all of
						those
						should be found.
						To check if the protein is available in our
						database mirror, click
						the "Check!" button. The accession-field
						turns green if the
						protein
						exists, and red in case the entered
						string does not match any of our
						records. If you don't know the
						accession number or ID, you can
						use the
						links on this page ("Search
						...").

								<img src="img/tutorial/tut_scanByAccession_s.gif" alt="Scan a protein by accession" />
							</a>
						</center>
					</li>
					<li>
						You can also
						<b>enter a protein sequence</b>
						by selecting
						<i>Input Sequence</i>
						from the the "Choose Protein By" listbox. You will have to
						enter a
						protein name and copy/paste your sequence into the
						given input
						fields. If numbers, spaces, or other invalid characters
						are
						included in the sequence, Scansite will remove them.

							</a>
						</center>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Choose which motif(s) to scan. You have the following choices:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Choose
						<b>All Motifs</b>
						from the listbox
						labeled "Look for" to scan for
						<i>All motifs in our database.</i>
						<center>
							<a href="img/tutorial/tut_scan_allMotifs.png" target="_blank">
								<img src="img/tutorial/tut_scan_allMotifs_s.gif" alt="Scan a protein for all motifs" />
							</a>
						</center>
					</li>
					<li>
						Choose
						<b>Selected Motifs and Groups</b>
						from the listbox
						labeled "Look for" to scan for
						<i>only the motif(s) and group(s)
							you selected</i>
						.
						Please select one or more motifs/groups here. If you select a
						group, all of the motifs that belong to that group will be
						included
						in your protein scan. However, you do not have to select
						a
						group.
						To see an overview of how motifs are categorized into
						groups,
						click the entitled "Show Group Definitions".

								<img src="img/tutorial/tut_scan_selectedMotifs_s.gif" alt="Scan a protein for selected motifs" />
							</a>
						</center>
					</li>
					<li>
						To use your own motif file, choose
						<b>User Motif</b>
						from the listbox
						labeled "Look for". You will be asked to choose
						the prepared file from
						your filesystem and to give your motif a
						descriptive name.
						<center>
							<a href="img/tutorial/tut_scan_inputMotif.png" target="_blank">
								<img src="img/tutorial/tut_scan_inputMotif_s.gif" alt="Scan a protein for an uploaded motif" />
							</a>
						</center>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Choose a stringency level: high, medium, low, or minimum.
				<br />

				This sets how high a sequence must score when compared to all
				sequences that match the motif within the reference scoring
				proteome
				used (by default the entire vertebrate collection of
				SwissProt
				proteins) to be shown in the result list.
				<br />

				<b>High stringency</b>
				indicates that the motif identified in the query sequence is
				within
				the top
				<b>0.2%</b>
				of all matching sequences contained in vertebrate SwissProt
				proteins.
				<b>Medium and low stringency</b>
				scores correspond to the top
				<b>1% and 5%</b>
				of
				sequence matches, respectively. The choice of
				<b>minimum</b>
				sets the threshold to
				<b>15%</b>
				, which basically allows most sites to pass. For uploaded motifs
				no
				reference
				proteome information is available. Therefore, a default
				score threshold of
				5 is used.
				<br />

				Sites identified under high stringency scoring are likely to be
				correct, though
				there is a possibility that real sites will fail to
				be identified (i.e.
				a
				non-zero false negative selection rate). In
				contrast, medium,
				low, and minimum stringency scoring has a much
				lower rate of
				false-negative
				predictions, but tends to over-call
				motif
				sites, resulting in
				increasing numbers of false positive hits.
			</li>
			<li>
				To show domains recognized in your sequence, check the box labeled
				"Show
				predicted domains". Otherwise, uncheck it. Scansite uses
				<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/pfa/iprscan/" target="_blank">InterProScan</a>
				to find a sequence's PFAM-domains. For this reason, the domain
				positions
				that are showed on the results page may differ slightly
				from domains
				the
				<a href="http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/" target="_blank">PFAM web page</a>
				returns.
			</li>
			<li>If you do not want to have your result sites compared to the
				default
				reference
				proteome (Vertebrates from Swissprot) you can check
				"Use Non-Standard
				Reference Proteome".
				This allows you to choose an
				alternative reference proteome: the Yeast
				Database.</li>
			<li>Click "Submit" to start your protein scan!</li>

					Your protein is shown here, drawn as a thin rectangle. If any
					sites
					were found,
					they are marked above the rectangle with a
					short-hand
					name of the
					domain type
					(in Scansite often called
					<i>motif group</i>
					, such as "Y_Kin", "SH2", or "PDZ").
					If you requested domains in
					your sequence to be shown, they will be
					marked as
					colored boxes with
					their names and residue ranges annotated below the
					rectangle.
					Further down, a plot of the surface accessibility
					indicates
					residues
					that are likely to be near the protein surface and thus
					able to
					interact with
					other proteins. However, our surface
					accessibility is
					calculated from
					the sequence,
					and not with
					reference to any known
					structures, so its accuracy may
					be limited.
					Between these to plots, a
					simple ruler indicates every hundredth
					position in the
					sequence.

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<strong>Predicted Motif Sites (Table)</strong>
				</td>
				<td>
					The table presented here shows all the predicted motif sites. You
					can sort the
					sites by selected columns (score, percentile, motif,
					group, site,
					sequence, and
					surface accessibility) by clicking on the
					table's header. Sorting by
					site will
					sort the sites by the positions
					in the sequence; sorting by sequence
					will sort the
					sites by the
					site's center position (usually s, t, or y). By default
					the sites
					are sorted by groups.
					<br />
					If the score-value is highlighted like a link, you can click it
					to
					have a
					histogram plot of the site within the reference proteome pop
					up in a
					separate
					browser window/tab. For Scansite motif scans (as
					opposed to input motif
					scans),
					the percentile displayed tells you
					the
					percentile that protein's
					score falls into
					compared with the
					selected
					reference proteome. The surface accessibility
					column
					tells
					you how
					accessible the sequence's position is to solvents
					(corresponds to
					the protein plot). Clicking on a link in the
					GeneCard-column takes
					you to that
					entry on the
					<a href="http://www.genecards.org/" target="_blank">Gene Card website</a>
					.
					The links in the sequence-column displays the full protein
					sequence
					with the site
					location highlighted in a new browser
					window/tab. The last column
					displays a link to
					phosphosite if the
					protein's site (e.g. T238) has an entry in
					<a href="http://www.phosphosite.org/" target="_blank">PhosphositePlus</a>
					. Please note that
					this reference is not motif specific, i.e. a
					Phosphosite-site that
					multiple motifs detected
					have the same link to
					Phosphosite! This feature is enabled for
					SwissProt proteins only at
					the moment.

		<b>Notes and Hints:</b>
		<br />
		<ul>
			<li>Most of the program execution time for Protein Scan is spent
				retrieving the Pfam
				domains. If you do not need domain information
				and have a lot of proteins
				to scan,
				you can save time by unselecting
				the "Show Predicted Domains" option.</li>
			<li>If motifs you expect are not found in your protein at Scansite's
				default "High"
				threshold setting, try using the "Medium" or "Low"
				settings. The "Low"
				setting often
				overwhelms the graphical display
				unless you are scanning with a small
				number of selected motifs.
				However, even if the graphical display
				looks cluttered, the table of
				results is always easily readable (just
				longer).</li>
			<li>Scansite scores are ranked on a 0 to infinity scale, where 0
				means
				a protein sequence perfectly matches the optimal binding
				pattern,
				and
				larger numbers indicate progressively poorer matches to
				the optimal
				consensus sequence. Lower scores in the output are thus
				better matches. (In the matrices, higher scores are better, so you
				should still use higher numbers in self-made matrices to indicate
				high affinities.)</li>
			<li>Clicking on the 15-residue sequence displayed in the results
				table shows the position of the site within the full protein
				sequence. Also, the page generated gives you a chance to submit
				this
				15-mer peptide to BLAST. This can let you check whether this
				site's
				sequence is conserved in organisms expected to be
				physiologically
				similar to this hit.</li>
			<li>If the sites found by Motif Scan seem believable, you can use the
				motifs for those sites to search databases for other hits. In
				favorable cases, this can allow you to piece together parts of a
				pathway, if the interacting parts of different proteins can be
				connected.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Search a Sequence Database for Motifs</h3>
		<p>This program searches all proteins in a selected (subset of a)
			database for
			matches to a motif or a selection of motifs.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				First of all, please select a "Search Method":
				<ul>
					<li>
						Choose
						<b>Database Motif</b>
						to search the database for occurrences of
						one Scansite motif. A
						listbox will be displayed that allows you to
						choose
						a motif.
						<center>
							<a href="img/tutorial/tut_dbsearch_singleMotif.png" target="_blank">
								<img src="img/tutorial/tut_dbsearch_singleMotif_s.gif" alt="Search database for a single motif" />
							</a>
						</center>
					</li>
					<li>
						Choose
						<b>Input Motif</b>
						to search the database for occurrences of
						your motif. You will
						have
						to choose a motif-file from your
						filesystem
						and enter a motif
						name.
						Detailed instructions about how to create a
						motif file are
						given on
						the
						<a href="#faq">FAQ</a>
						page.
						<center>
							<a href="img/tutorial/tut_dbsearch_inputMotif.png" target="_blank">
								<img src="img/tutorial/tut_dbsearch_inputMotif_s.gif" alt="Search database for an uploaded motif" />
							</a>
						</center>
					</li>
					<li>
						If you have insufficient information to make a full matrix of
						binding affinities, but you have a tentative consensus sequence
						describing your motif, you can still put this into Scansite and
						search the database for matches. Choose
						<b>Quick Motif</b>
						to use
						this option, and have the consensus sequence available so
						you can
						enter it.
						<br />
						Scansite will then construct a rough matrix matching the
						characteristics of
						your consensus sequence, and this can be used
						to
						search the
						databases.
						The results in this case will be less
						quantitative.
						However, many users have found this program useful
						for quickly finding
						proteins with certain sequence
						characteristics.
						<br />
						On the page there are two rows of small text boxes, labeled as
						positions -7 to
						+7, with 0 being the required fixed position.
						Start
						by entering
						your fixed
						residue in the only box at position 0.
						In the
						primary preference row
						(top one), enter the
						residues of your
						consensus sequence in their position relative to your
						fixed
						residue. You can also enter more than one residues in any text
						box
						("ST", for example).
						Some wildcards are allowed too (they are
						described on the page).
						Scansite will give residues in the top row
						a score of 9.0. For
						positions with no residue
						preference, leave it
						blank or use "X" (any residue).
						<br />
						In the secondary preference row (bottom one), you can enter
						alternative residues at some
						positions if desired. These will be
						given a lower score of 4.5, and thus
						allows
						you to specify a weaker
						affinity for some residue types.
						<center>
							<a href="img/tutorial/tut_dbsearch_quick.png" target="_blank">
								<img src="img/tutorial/tut_dbsearch_quick_s.gif" alt="Search database for a pattern-like motif" />
							</a>
						</center>
					</li>
					<li>
						You can also search for proteins that match
						<b>Multiple Motifs</b>
						. Since this method is
						incredibly computationally expensive, the
						search limits you to a maximum
						of 5 motifs.
						You can combine your
						own
						motifs with scansite motifs if you want.
						Just select or/and
						upload
						motifs and choose a restriction method for your search.
						Your
						options
						are
						<i>Gap Penalty</i>
						and
						<i>Strict Distance Bounds</i>
						. Using a gap penalty is much faster than specifying strict
						distance bounds, because it only evaluates a proteins best
						scoring
						motif sites, whereas the
						other method evaluates all
						combinations of
						sites that are found.
						<br />
						A high gap penalty adds a penalizes distances between motif
						sites
						more than a medium one,
						and so on.
						<br />
						If choose to use strict distance bounds, you can specify up to
						three bounds. Please be aware that
						you have to select the motifs
						you want to use before you can choose
						them from the listboxes
						in
						this section. Only distance bounds between distinct motifs are
						permitted, i.e. you have to
						select two distinct motifs for
						specifying a bound.

		<ul>
			<li>
				The search options in this and the other Scansite database
				programs
				are
				intended to address common problems with database searches. For
				many
				searches, you may only be interested in matches from humans
				or a
				model organism. Restricting your search to proteins from a
				single
				species is done by entering that species name in the "Single
				species" text box. Scansite uses a MySQL database, and the regular
				expressions syntax supported by MySQL allows certain helpful
				wildcards. For example, if you are tired of writing out
				"Caenorhabditis elegans", you can use "C.* elegans" instead. In a
				regular
				expression, the period (.) matches any single character, and
				the asterisk
				extends
				that match to multiple characters (or even zero
				characters). You could
				also do genus-wide
				searches, by entering
				"Rattus" for example. If you try doing that
				with "Mus", you will
				accidentally match "Ther
				<U>mus</U>
				aquaticus" as well, but you can
				avoid that by entering "^Mus". The
				caret symbol (^) requires the text
				to match at the beginning
				of the
				entered name. Another pitfall to avoid is specifying an
				invertebrate
				species like "Drosophila melanogaster" when your Organism Class
				setting
				is "Mammals". You will get
				no hits, because no entry in
				Genpept has a source organism that is
				both a mammal
				and a fruit fly.
				(At least, the Genpept curators hope no entry like
				that is present.)
			</li>
			<li>
				The molecular weight, isoelectric point, and phosphorylation
				options are intended for use in conjunction with two-dimensional
				gel
				electrophoresis experiments. When you find a few spots
				appearing
				reproducibly on a 2D gel under a particular test
				condition and not
				under the control, you could use
				Scansite to find what proteins are
				expected to be in that region of the
				2-D gel by
				putting in a molecular
				weight range and isoelectric point. You
				could simultaneously
				constrain the species to match the cell line
				you used in the
				experiment. If it is an experiment involving
				possible phosphorylation
				events, you can see how much a putative
				phosphorylation would move it
				on the gel.
			</li>
			<li>
				The keyword search is primarily only useful for searching
				Swiss-Prot, because of its detailed annotations. It might be
				useful
				in Genpept if you are searching for novel proteins, in
				which case you
				could search for phrases like "hypothetical".
			</li>
			<li>
				The "Sequence contains" text field is a quick way to restrict
				your
				search to proteins containing a consensus sequence. Please note
				that
				the desired consensus sequence does NOT need to be part of the
				motif
				being
				searched for. Regular expressions have to be used here
				instead of the
				protein
				wildcard signs ("." instead of "X", "[ND]"
				instead of "B",...). For
				example, the
				sequence "PXXP" is represented
				as "P..P" in regular expression syntax.
				More details
				about regular
				expressions are given on the "FAQ" page.
